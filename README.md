# Hoverboard-Project
This is a cool little hoverboard where u can generate colors by just moving your mouse pointer over the squares in the grid.
We can change the number of visible squares by modifying the 'squares' variable at the start of our script.jss.
we can also give custom colors to the squares by simply adding a list of colors in the variable 'colors'.
i used coolors for the palettes...

**i plan to soon include glow effect, color palette selection button, light-dark mode switch and other cool features...**
