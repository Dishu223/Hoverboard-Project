# Hoverboard-Project
This is a cool little hoverboard where u can generate colors by just moving your mouse pointer over the squares in the grid.
We can change the number of visible squares by modifying the 'squares' variable at the start of our script.jss.
we can also give custom colors to the squares by simply adding a list of colors in the variable 'colors'.
i used coolors for the palettes...

**if you want to run this code, just copy the index.html, style.css and script.js files to a single folder. open that folder in vs code
then finally, run the index.html (either Show Preview or Open with Live Server).

**i plan to soon include glow effect, color palette selection button, light-dark mode switch and other cool features...**
